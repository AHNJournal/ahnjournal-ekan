/**
 * Default Variables.
 *
 * Modify this file to provide default Bootstrap Framework variables. The
 * Bootstrap Framework will not override any variables defined here because it
 * uses the `!default` flag which will only set their default if not already
 * defined here.
 *
 * You can copy existing variables directly from the following file:
 * ./THEMENAME/bootstrap/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss
